Things to do for the 0.17 release:

Repair broken images, as per bug 3745:
    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3745

Check the wiki for any edit requests.

Do author authority control.
 * Clean out leading and trailing whitespace.
 * Merge Architetto Francesco Rollandin as per the messages from imia@email.it

Delete the 44 broken files that should be replaced by the fixed files
   in 37_fixed_files.zip for release 0.17.  Otherwise we will probably
   end up with duplicates and just as many broken files as before.  A
   shell script to do the deletion is here:
