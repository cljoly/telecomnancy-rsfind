G'day,  


Welcome to the Etiquette Icon Theme for the GNOME desktop.

This theme has strong style influences from the following themes

* Jimmac's Industrial/Gorilla icon themes
* Garret's Bluecurve icon theme
* Everaldo's Crystal SVG icon theme


Their work astounds me and this is my attempt at unification between styles while also adding my own influence.
Hopefully etiquette will evolve into a calm, clean & refined set of SVG graphics and icons that everyone will enjoy :)




Etiquette may never be complete ..  but should the releases reach 1.0 they would sureley have:

* All fonts and colour pallets controlled by stylesheet
* Icons renderable by all major SVG renderers including but not limited to AdobeSVG, Cairo, LibrSVG
* Huge gnome application iconset and GTK iconset to match
* Great rendering speed/perfomance


With that said.  you can look forward to many more point releases as the collection grows and matures.

Also, feel free to contact me with requests / comments.   And yes, I will make requested icons with priority ;-)
