I choose the strawberry.svg made by Nicu Buculei.

SVG exported from Scribus:
    strawberry_border.svg

Scribus document template which can be loaded as a regular document or
used with a New From Template plugin which is included in the cvs
version of Scribus:
    strawberry_border.tar.gz

Phases I did to create this:

Import an svg:
    import.png

Scale the svg with properties palette or ctrl + mouse drag

Place it to the top left corner.

Select Item -> Multiple Duplicate:
    multiple_duplicate.png

and the top has been done:
    top.png

select all the strawberries and choose Item -> group. Copy and paste
Drag the new strawberry row to the bottom of the page:
    top_and_bottom.png

For a better look rotate the top left and right strawberries
    rotate.png

and select Item -> Multiple Duplicate once again for both top left and
right strawberries:
    multiple_duplicate2.png

Now the border has been created:
    done.png
